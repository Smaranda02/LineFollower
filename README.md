# LineFollower 🚘 - Formula-E 🚘

This is was a team project created during the Robotics class at my university. The purpose was to organize a competition between students, who had the aim of developing the fastest car to finish the circuit. My teammates are also the collaborators of this repository. Check their Github too!👀 


## Components used : 

 - QTR-8A reflectance sensor
 - L293D motor driver 
 - DC motors (2) ⚙️
 - Power source ( LiPo battery ) 🔋
 - Arduino Uno
 - Zip-ties
 - Wheels (2) 
 - Ball caster
 - Chassis
 - Small Breadboard



## The brains behind 🧠
The system control was created with the help of PID ( Proportional Integral Derivative) tuning. Through trial and error approach combined with theoretical foundations we were able to find the best parameters to suit our designed car model. 

## Final results 🏅
 - Final time : ... seconds ⌚️
 - Leaderboard position :
